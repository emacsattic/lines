;;;COMMENTARY: lines functions to help deal with data-files..

;;; Sometimes you want to use lines- functions instead of point-
;;; functions, even though it is slower.  Particularly if u r dealing with
;;; parsing/editing a data-file, with, say data arranged in columns.
;;; lines.el defines most lines- counterparts of (point-max) (point-min)
;;; (point) (kill-region) etc. [for instance, emacs' default lines-what
;;; does not return an integer, which is what u may want during
;;; programming]

;;; Lines.el also defines functions such as  lines-get-fields (which gets
;;; all fields on this line, assuming they are lisp-expressions). 


;;; BEFORE DOING ANYTHING WITH A BUFFER, please do not forget to call 
;;;; lines-narrow-initial..
